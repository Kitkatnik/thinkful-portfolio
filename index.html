				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h3 id="professional">Professional</h3>
				<p>I've been passionabte about coding since MySpace was popular and Neopets & Gaia Online were the communities to be in. I initially learned HTML and CSS playing around on those sites, and even sold custom layouts and pages to other users for in-game currency or other bartering services.</p>
				<p>After a decade of working primarily in front-end development, I've taken a step to learn back-end development. With the leadership skills I have learned through hiring and managing dev teams, I am confident in my ability to become a full-stack developer for companies that are improving humanity through their products.</p>
				<p>My main focus is to work with companies that support the mental health industry, LGBTQ+ communities, or create resources to protect against violence and abuse. In these companies, I aim to innovate on existing systems and processes, providing clean, high-quality code and solutions that users find easy to use, reliable, and necessary in their daily lives.</p>
				<h3 id="#personal">Personal</h3>
				<p>I'm a HUGE video game nerd. My current obsession is with Stardew Valley, not just because of the gameplay but because Eric Barone is one of my biggest inspirations. He not only developed the game entirely on his own, but he also did the graphics, the music, and built a close-knit community around the game.</p>
				<p>I'm also a musician and love to play piano and ukulele. I'm definitely into classical music as a pianist, but enjoy a wide variety of music... Especially EDM and Disney songs ;)</p>
				<p>Outside of work, I volunteer as a foster at Atlanta Humane Society and Lifeline, primarily fostering kittens. I also enjoy kayaking, finding the best dessert spots, and playing board games with friends at our local nerd-spot, Battle and Brew.</p>
